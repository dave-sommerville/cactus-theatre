            <p>
              When they're out of minions but a mortal needs to face their past before they die, sometimes the god of death must step in.
              It's just Tom's luck to both find out he's dying and to be escorted through his regrets
              by a surly deity who's out of practice. At least his best friend Jackie (and her trusty cactus, Angie) are coming along as emotional support.
              Written by Daniel Gilmour, who left the world's stage too soon. Cactus is a dark comedy about life, death, love and loss that we now perform in his memory.

                Jordan has been a part of Winnipeg's theatre scene for over fifteen years. He has written a number of plays, and both directed and acted with various theatre companies around the city. Some of his credits include Lame Is... (Sick+Twisted Theatre, 2017), Your Brain On Anxiety (Sheep On A Mission, 2018), Letters (Parachuting Camel Productions, 2019, 2020, 2022), Shakespeare's The Tempest (Indifferently Reformed, 2023), Glad To Be Here (Theatre By The River, 2023), and Captain Ted: Disabled Pirate (Strokes of Genius, 2024).
              </p>
              <p>
                While they met some years previous, Jordan first got to work with Dan on The Beggar and the Wolf with Merlyn Productions in 2019. The last show they worked on together was a radio production of Letters: War Within with Parachuting Camel Productions which Jordan directed for release in 2024, making it Dan's final, posthumous performance. It is an honour to help bring Cactus to the stage in Dan's memory.

Since then, they collaborated on several projects, including C*A*S*H* (BS Comedy Players), a Zoom reading of Last Christmas (as Clara Oswald and The Doctor), and other script readings. She remains grateful to Dan for introducing her to Doctor Who and Sherlock—despite her initial reluctance.

                I started acting over 70 years ago, in German at Manchester University, continued in English in the UK and Canada, and worked for several years in French with the Cercle Molière, the francophone professional equivalent to RMTC. As well as theatre work, I have also done a lot of voice work, from providing a voice for a Japanese dry cleaner, to narrating an award-winning documentary, as well as TV gigs. Of all this, my favourite has always been live theatre, in front of an appreciative audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Live theatre needs rehearsals, which gives rise to wonderful friendships - like Dan Gilmour, a fantastic actor, who passed away at 38. This was a great loss to the local theatre community, and to me and all those were privileged to call him a friend.

                A veteran of three community theatre groups, and appearing in three productions with Dan Gilmore, Rick is proud to have been asked to be a part of the crew for this fantastic production. Watching this group of incredible talent come together to perform Dan’s words has been an amazing journey. Looking forward to the final product.
